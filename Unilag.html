    <h1>A Description of Myself</h1>
    <p>I go by the name Osei-Owusu Nana Yaw. I hail from Akim-Tafo which is located in the Eastern subberb of Ghana. I'm actually a pure Akim as both parents are from the Akim tribe. My mum's hometown is Akim-Tafo whilst my dad's is Kukurantumi. My mum introduced me to the world on the 5th of July 2001. Korlebu Teaching hospital heard my first cry that day.<br> I was born with a choclate complexion. Till date my complexion remains the same as I've never attempted the use of a bleeching cream. I'm five foot 6 in height and my shoe size is forty-four.My love for basketball gets me bouncing the bball at my leisure time mostly. I also love reading and watching movies on Netflix.  </p>
